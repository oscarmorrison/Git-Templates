All public repositories expecting open source contributions should have a few basic files to assist contributors and users of the software.


These key documents are:

### README.md

The Readme is the first document that is displayed at the Repository level. 

### CONTRIBUTING.md

Contributing is a doc that explains to future contributors how you would like people to contribute.
